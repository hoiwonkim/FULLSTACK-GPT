It has glass doors at the entrance and is described as having a hallway that smells of boiled cabbage and old rag mats. The building is seven floors high, and Winston's flat is located on the seventh floor. The flat is accessed by stairs since the lift is often not working due to the electricity being cut off during daylight hours as part of an economy drive. The hallway of Victory Mansions also has a large colored poster depicting the face of a man with a black mustache.\")"
